# Security Policy

- This is a template; projects copied from it must add project-specific contacts and SLAs.
- Do not include secrets in the template. Replace this file after adoption with real reporting steps.
- If a vulnerability is found in the template itself, open an issue in the hosting repository with reproduction details only (no sensitive data).
