# Contributing

- This repository is a template. Keep files minimal and free of project-specific content.
- When copying into a project, add only the missing files and keep universal files unchanged unless updating the template itself.
- Propose template changes via pull requests with clear rationale; document dependency or interface changes with a new ADR under `docs/adr/`.
- Log every command run while editing the template in `docs/ops/findings.md`.
- Keep diffs small, rules enforceable, and instructions in checklists or bullet points.
